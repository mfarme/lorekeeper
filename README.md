**Open Dungeon Master** runs multiplayer (and solo) Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e
campaigns with an AI Dungeon Master, fully on your own machine. A local model is
the creative mind and narrator; a stack of server-side engines enforces the 5e
rules for both the players and the DM. **The narrator never owns the numbers** —
dice, hit points, spell slots, conditions, and the death track are computed and
clamped by the backend, and the model changes game state only through tools the
server validates.

It began as a fork of [Open Dungeon](https://github.com/newideas99/open-dungeon)
to add multiplayer, and grew into a different app: the AI drives the session,
requesting rolls, starting encounters, and playing NPCs and companions, following
a secret story arc it regenerates as the campaign moves.

This Lorekeeper fork makes the local [Lemonade](https://lemonade-server.ai/)
server the primary provider. Chat, Kokoro TTS, Moonshine STT, and
OpenAI-compatible image generation stay behind the Lorekeeper server; the
browser never receives a Lemonade credential or talks to it directly.

## How it works

- **The engines own the rules.** The model narrates and makes creative calls, but
  it can only touch game state through server tools that are clamped, audit-logged,
  and published live to every player. It treats player messages as intent, not
  outcome.
- **The AI drives the table.** It asks the server for rolls (`request_roll`), starts
  and runs combat, plays NPCs and AI companions, moves the party, and decides when
  to spotlight specific players for input.
- **It follows a secret story arc.** Every campaign gets a hidden spine generated at
  start and refreshed with a small clamped delta each time a chapter closes, so the
  plot advances without the model rewriting history. Player-safe pieces surface as
  the quest log; DM-only hooks stay hidden.

The authoritative ledger of exactly what is enforced, what is guidance, and what is
out of scope is [docs/rules-coverage.md](docs/rules-coverage.md).

## Systems &amp; engines

The app is a stack of about fifty focused engines. The split is deliberate: pure
rules math lives in `src/lib/srd/` (database-free, each with its own test), and the
server-side enforcement and tool handlers live in `src/lib/dm/`. The model narrates
and makes creative calls, but it never adjudicates: every number below is computed
and clamped by code.

### Combat (server-enforced)

- **PC attack engine** - resolves player weapon and spell attacks: weapon pick, to-hit, damage, AC adjudication, and feature riders.
- **Enemy damage and enemy attack engines** - the single server path for damage landing on an enemy and for monster attacks rolled against PC AC; also owns encounter-finish.
- **Death and dying engine** - death-save state at 0 HP, auto-rolled saves on skipped turns, massive-damage instant death, and stabilize/heal clears.
- **Conditions engine** - the SRD condition table with round and save-ends durations and resistances, plus a named buff-condition registry (Bless, Shield of Faith, and the like).
- **Concentration engine** - casting sets and breaks it, incoming damage forces the CON save server-side, and dropping to 0 HP ends it.
- **Action economy and multiattack engine** - the per-turn action/bonus/reaction budget, Extra Attack, once-per-turn riders like Sneak Attack, Dash/Disengage, and Haste.
- **Opportunity attack engine** - fires when a token leaves an enemy's reach and resolves the reaction attack server-side.
- **Spell and cast engine** - derives save DC, half-on-save, damage type, and applied conditions from data; covers cast-at-enemy, cast-at-player, area-of-effect, and buffs.
- **Aura engine** - position-aware Aura of Protection reaching nearby allies on the battle map, non-stacking.
- **Initiative and encounter engine** - deterministic initiative order, enemy spawning, and the encounter turn pointer.

### Character sheet rules

- **Sheet derivation engine** - central compute of AC, saves, spell attack and DC, and passive scores from what the character actually is and wears.
- **Armor and AC engine** - the SRD armor table plus AC math (DEX caps, STR requirements, shields), shared by the server and the character builder.
- **Weapons engine** - the SRD weapon table with proficiency and the properties (finesse, thrown, reach, ammunition) the attack engine reads.
- **Class features engine** - grants SRD and genre-class features by level and subclass, including subclass always-prepared spells.
- **Feature effects engine** - turns feature names into typed mechanical riders (fighting styles, damage riders, defenses) and parses authored prose into them.
- **Class resource pools engine** - Rage, Ki, Channel Divinity, Second Wind, Lay on Hands, Bardic Inspiration and the rest: counts, recharge type, and effects.
- **Spell scaling engine** - cantrip tier scaling and per-slot damage and heal increases derived from SRD data rather than trusted to the model.
- **Class options engine** - invocations, maneuvers, metamagic, pact boons, infusions, runes, and disciplines stored as choice-sourced features.
- **ASI and point-buy engine** - ability-score-improvement thresholds (cap 20) and the standard 27-point point buy for creation.
- **Rest engine** - short and long rest math: hit-dice recovery, slot and resource refill, and condition pruning.
- **Multiclass engine** - ability prerequisites both ways, the shared multiclass slot table, per-class caster contribution, and a 3-class cap.

### Transformations, pets, and companions

- **Transformation and polymorph engine** - real beast stat blocks for Wild Shape and Polymorph, with overflow damage and form reversion.
- **Pet and familiar engine** - familiars, the Beast Master companion, the Drakewarden drake, and story pets, each validated against its source feature.
- **Companion engine** - full companion characters with their own sheet and bot user, added to initiative and the battle map and auto-leveled with the party.

### Items and anti-cheat

- **Magic item effects engine** - mechanical items (AC, save bonuses, resistances) gated by carried, equipped, and attuned state, feeding the same AC engine.
- **Consumables and items logic** - healing-potion tiers, generic consumable detection, and ammunition lookup.
- **Sheet mutation guard** - a server ceiling on DM-driven sheet edits that blocks illegitimate level, HP, gold, ability, and XP jumps no matter how the model is prompted.
- **Inventory approval engine** - an optional mode that turns DM inventory and gold changes into player-approved proposals instead of applying them immediately.

### Leveling and XP

- **XP and leveling engine** - the XP thresholds and level-for-XP math (the level-up itself is applied through the player's own in-app flow).
- **Milestone XP engine** - chapter-close awards, so roleplay-heavy campaigns still level.

### World simulation

- **Overworld and region map generation** - seeded value-noise terrain on a 96x72 grid with genre reskins, reconciling locations to anchors lazily as the party travels.
- **Battle map generation** - seeded tactical maps (terrain, lighting, spawns, line of sight and cover, movement budgets, pathfinding), regenerable from the encounter.
- **Location persistence** - structured per-area layout, exits, and connections so narration stays spatially consistent, plus an illustrated top-down map image.
- **Living-world tick engine** - a zero-model-call heartbeat that advances world state on dice and computes encounter pressure after each narration.
- **World arcs** - one or two escalating off-screen storylines that advance whether or not the party engages them.
- **NPC agency** - once-per-chapter goal advancement for every tracked NPC with no model call, surfacing outcomes as rumors and world facts.
- **World facts register** - authoritative player-visible and DM-only facts extracted from play and fed to prompts as canon or rumor.
- **Social and NPC attitude system** - attitudes tracked across sessions and `social_check` rolls against attitude-derived DCs that can shift them.
- **NPC roster hygiene** - NPCs the party has ignored for chapters archive out of the prompt and restore on a name mention, and close name matches the engine refuses to merge on its own ("Aldric" and "Alaric") queue for the lead to merge, rename, or dismiss. Merging keeps the old spelling as an alias; it never rewrites past narration.
- **World utility engines** - CR-scaled treasure moved into real purses, object durability, and forced-march exhaustion via real CON saves.

### Narrative

- **Story arc and saga engine** - a three-tier secret spine (campaign-spanning saga, current-act beats, quest-scale sub-arcs) refreshed with clamped deltas and sequel chaining.
- **Chapter engine** - chapters close on completed story beats rather than message volume, triggering XP, fact extraction, NPC agency, memory indexing, and a snapshot.
- **Recap and compaction** - a rolling campaign summary and history compaction that keep prompts bounded.
- **Chapter rewind and snapshots** - a full world-state snapshot at each chapter open; a lead-confirmed rewind restores a boundary after taking a safety copy.
- **Narration reroll** - the lead rerolls a DM paragraph with optional guidance ("darker", "more dialogue") and browses the takes. Only the words change: the dice, the sheets and every resolved outcome stay byte-identical.
- **Continue scene** - extends a narration that stopped short, in place. Not a turn: no counters, no chapter close, no world tick.
- **Inline narration edit** - the lead fixes a typo or a wrong name directly, with every dice-roll marker preserved across the edit or the save refused.
- **Director controls** - a one-turn steer the lead arms from the Direct composer mode: a canned event type, or a free-text direction sent privately, consumed exactly once. Players see that something is armed, never what it says.
- **Arc beat editor** - reword, reorder, skip, set `[NOW]`, or add a single main beat instead of regenerating the whole spine. Beats that already played are immutable; they are a record, not a plan.
- **Story export** - finished campaigns and chapters exported to DOCX, ODT, or HTML.

### Memory and retrieval (RAG)

- **Semantic recall and memory index** - MiniLM (384-dim) two-phase recall over chapter summaries then verbatim scene chunks, behind the `recall_story` tool.
- **World lore builder** - lead-authored, embedded canon retrieved per turn, with `search_lore` searching lore, facts, notes, and chapter memory at once.
- **House rules and rules manager** - embedded house-rules text plus structured variant toggles, retrieved into the prompt's variant and house-rules blocks.
- **Per-turn context retrieval** - embeds the current moment once and rides only the most relevant lore and rule chunks into the prompt.
- **Lore check** - a player-flagged consistency verifier that returns a verdict, citations, and a suggested rewrite.
- **Pinned memories** - select a passage in any DM message and pin it; pins ride in every prompt under a hard token cap, and a pin that would blow the cap is refused rather than silently evicting an older one.
- **Token-aware context budget** - per-section allocation with floors against the model's real context window, replacing a flat character count, with stable blocks ordered before volatile ones for prefix-cache hits.
- **Context inspector** - a lead-only panel showing exactly what the DM was sent last turn, block by block, with token cost and the reason anything was dropped.
- **Importance-tiered chapter LOD** - sealed chapters render as a full summary or a one-line synopsis by recency and importance, and degrade by tiering down before anything is dropped, so an old but pivotal chapter outlives a recent forgettable one.
- **House-rule trigger keywords** - a rule reachable only by a word the party rarely uses no longer has to out-score everything else for one of three retrieval slots; a keyword hit admits it outright. Small enough rules documents skip retrieval entirely and ride whole.

### AI and LLM integration

- **Model client (dual provider)** - streaming against an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` server (llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM, OpenRouter) or a local Ollama.
- **DM turn engine** - a persisted park/resume state machine and tool-calling loop (up to four rounds) that salvages malformed tool calls and streams filtered narration.
- **DM prompt and tool families** - a rules-as-tools system prompt covering rolls, checks, encounters, casts, resources, rests, conditions, items, hazards, NPCs, notes, maps, and world.
- **Engine boundary contract** - one explicit block naming the eight classes of fact the engine owns, so the model writes the prose and never the math.
- **Halted-turn retry** - a crashed turn no longer wedges the table. The lead sends it back in and it resumes from the persisted conversation, so nothing is re-rolled and no context is lost.
- **Context-window detection** - the real window is read from the server (llama.cpp `/props`, including the `--models-preset` router) rather than assumed, and cached per base URL and model.
- **Per-role sampling** - separate story and utility sampling with named profiles, and a cloud-safe versus local-only parameter split so a local-only key never reaches a strict endpoint.
- **Per-stage engine toggles** - every optional pipeline stage (compaction, recall, retrieval, chapter summary) is switchable per campaign with an engine-versus-model cost badge.
- **Background-work visibility** - compaction, chapter seals, world ticks, lore checks and Asks surface as labelled chips with elapsed time instead of an opaque wait.
- **TTS narration** - local Kokoro renders each DM message on the serial media queue, autoplayed latest-only with per-user mute.
- **STT push-to-talk** - proxies audio to a local faster-whisper service, kept off the network.
- **Portrait generation** - a one-shot ComfyUI character portrait at creation, with an icon fallback.

### Human DM and the workshop

- **Viewer roles and caps** - one pure decision for who sees the secret arc, real enemy numbers, and the unfogged map: the lead at an AI table, the DM seat at a human one.
- **Adjudication facade** - a catalog of 64 engine adjudications the human DM invokes from the console, the same handlers the AI reaches through tools.
- **Assisted-mode delegation** - the DM hands the AI the monsters' turns, beat read-alouds, or a counted cover stretch while they step away; the AI spends one answer per turn it takes.
- **Story-beat capture** - a cadence nudge reminds the DM to jot beats between voice narration, and beats feed the same chapter summaries, recaps and exports an AI table gets.
- **DM console panels** - initiative editing, bestiary and NPC forges, a map studio and map library, roll tables, encounter prep with live difficulty, odds, effects and scene tracking.
- **Roll visibility** - public, DM-only, blind and self rolls, redacted rather than hidden so a secret roll still visibly happened.
- **Workshop kind** - a campaign row that never plays: same content tables, same editors, no AI turns, measured against a stand-in target party.
- **Content import** - a transactional planner/executor pair copies lore, locations, maps, NPCs, encounters, tables, storyboards and house rules from a workshop or campaign into a new campaign, renumbering collisions.
- **Cloning** - whole workshops and campaigns clone (prep travels, transcript does not), library characters duplicate, and individual assets copy in place.

### Live table audio and dice

- **Voice SFU** - in-process mediasoup with floor-aware turn taking, side rooms, hand raising, and optional proximity, whisper/shout range, wall attenuation and downed-deafness rules.
- **Ambience engine** - a 65-cue catalog in three layers (bed, music, sting) driven by the AI's tools, the DM's hand, or scene inference, with per-listener volume and TTS ducking.
- **Dice sources** - per die shape, each player picks typed physical entry, a server roll, or a paired Pixels Bluetooth die; rolls auto-submit when no die needs typing.

### Platform and multiplayer

- **Event bus (SSE)** - per-campaign publish/subscribe, the real-time multiplayer backbone.
- **Media queue** - a global serial GPU queue (one ComfyUI or TTS job at a time) since the iGPU shares memory with the DM model.
- **Whispers and side-chat** - one-way DM-to-player whispers and private player-to-player threads that never enter the DM prompt or the shared stream.
- **Ask, and the note back** - out-of-character questions answered from the campaign record without moving the story, plus a one-turn note a player can hand the DM. The note is drafted from your own thread, shown in an editable box, and only sent once you confirm the exact text.
- **Turn, lead, and pending-roll flow** - lead controls, turn coalescing, and parked physical-dice roll requests.
- **Auth** - session cookies with scrypt hashing, optional Discord OAuth, and reverse-proxy-aware origin resolution.
- **Login throttle** - a per-username-and-IP lockout with backoff.
- **Admin panel and global config** - admin-gated settings with database-over-env-over-default precedence and a sign-ups toggle.
- **Encrypted storage** - single-writer SQLite encrypted at rest (ChaCha20) alongside the read-only Open5e content pack.

## Requirements

- **Node 22+** (npm). `npm install` pulls everything the app itself needs. Or
  **Docker**, if you would rather not install a toolchain at all: see
  [Run with Docker](#run-with-docker).
- **A local Lemonade server** (`lemond`) at `http://127.0.0.1:13305` with the
  configured chat model `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTP-ROCmFP4-GGUF-STRIX-embF16-headQ6`.
  Lemonade exposes the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Or
  use any other OpenAI-compatible server with tool calling: llama.cpp, Ollama,
  LM Studio, vLLM, TabbyAPI, KoboldCpp, or OpenRouter.
- **ffmpeg** for the Lemonade STT boundary, which converts browser WebM/Opus
  recordings to the PCM16 WAV accepted by Moonshine.
- **Optional services** (each feature simply stays off, or falls back to a
  placeholder, without it):
  - [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) at `:8188` for character
    portraits, inline scene art, and battle maps
    ([docs/image-generation.md](docs/image-generation.md))
  - [Kokoro-FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI) at `:8880` for DM
    voice narration
  - a faster-whisper server at `:8870` for push-to-talk
    ([docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md))

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mfarme/lorekeeper.git && cd lorekeeper
npm ci

# The database is encrypted at rest; start-lemonade creates this once.
# For a manually managed key, write DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY to .env.server.

# Build the content pack: spells, feats, items, subclasses, monsters.
# Downloads from api.open5e.com once, then caches for offline re-runs.
node scripts/import-open5e.mjs

# Warm the local embedding model (MiniLM, ~86MB) into models/embeddings.
npm run fetch-model

npm run build
npm run start:lemonade  # http://localhost:3005
```

`start:lemonade` verifies Lemonade at `http://127.0.0.1:13305/live`, creates a
local database key if needed, and starts the LAN listener on port 3005. Set
`LEMONADE_BASE_URL` to point at another Lemonade host. The same server-side
adapter covers `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/audio/speech`,
`/v1/audio/transcriptions`, and `/v1/images/generations`.

If you are using a different OpenAI-compatible stack, set
`OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL`; `KOKORO_URL`, `STT_URL`, and
`OPENAI_IMAGE_BASE_URL` remain available as per-modality overrides.

The Lemonade server supplies the DM model and is normally already running on
this machine. The legacy standalone llama.cpp instructions remain below as an
alternate backend.

**The first account registered becomes the server admin.** To promote someone on an
existing install: `node scripts/make-admin.mjs <username>`.

### Content pack

`node scripts/import-open5e.mjs` builds `data/content/open5e.sqlite`, the read-only
pack holding every spell, feat, item, subclass, lineage and monster the character
builder and the DM can reach. Raw API pages are cached under `data/content/raw/`, so
later runs need no network; `--refresh` re-downloads them, and `CONTENT_DB_PATH`
points the app at a pack somewhere else.

Run it before your first session. The app still boots without the pack, but it falls
back to the much smaller bundled SRD 5.1 data in `src/lib/srd/` and shows a hint to
run the import, so players will find most content missing. The pack is not committed:
it is third-party open-licensed content (OGL, ORC and CC-BY documents) rebuildable
from the script in one command. See [docs/content.md](docs/content.md) and
[docs/LICENSES.md](docs/LICENSES.md).

For real sessions build and run the production server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:lan   # 0.0.0.0:3005
```

## Run with Docker

The image is the whole install. It carries the built app, the Open5e content pack and
the MiniLM embedding model, so a fresh container needs no network and no setup steps.
Only the AI services stay outside, on the host.

Every GitHub release is published to both registries as linux/amd64:

```bash
docker pull lebbi/open-dungeon-master:latest                 # Docker Hub
docker pull ghcr.io/lebbitheplow/open-dungeon-master:latest  # GHCR
```

Grab the compose file and start it:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lebbitheplow/open-dungeon-master/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d        # http://localhost:3005
```

`:latest` follows the newest release; pin one with `ODM_IMAGE_TAG=0.10.1` in `.env`. The
compose file pulls from Docker Hub by default; set
`ODM_IMAGE=ghcr.io/lebbitheplow/open-dungeon-master` in `.env` to use GHCR instead. To
build the image yourself from a clone rather than pulling it, use
`docker compose up -d --build`.

Nothing else is required. On first boot the container generates a database encryption
key, stores it in the data volume, and prints it once:

```
docker compose logs | head -20
```

**Back that key up.** The database is encrypted at rest with it and there is no
recovery path without it. If you would rather manage it yourself, put
`DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...` in a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml` before the first
start; an explicit key always wins over the stored one.

### Pointing at your AI services

The container reaches the host through `host.docker.internal`, so Lemonade on
`127.0.0.1:13305` becomes `http://host.docker.internal:13305/v1`. Every URL is
overridable in `.env`; copy [.env.docker.example](.env.docker.example) for the full
list.

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env    # then edit, then: docker compose up -d
```

On Linux you can instead share the host network stack, which makes the plain
`127.0.0.1` defaults work exactly as they do in a host install:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.host-net.yml up -d
```

### Data, backups and maintenance

Four named volumes hold everything worth keeping: `odm-data` (the encrypted database
and the generated key), `odm-uploads` (avatars and portraits), `odm-generated` (scene
art and maps) and `odm-audio` (cached narration). `docker compose down` leaves them
alone; `docker compose down -v` destroys them.

Maintenance scripts need the database key, so run them through the entrypoint, which
loads it:

```bash
docker compose exec open-dungeon-master ./scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh \
  node scripts/make-admin.mjs <username>
```

**Run exactly one container.** The app is a single synchronous SQLite writer with an
in-process event bus, so it cannot be replicated or pointed at a shared volume from two
hosts. See [Storage and the single-writer rule](#storage-and-the-single-writer-rule).

To move to a newer release: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. The volumes
carry over. If you build locally instead, `docker compose up -d --build` refreshes the
content pack from api.open5e.com, so the build needs network; the running container
never does.

### Publishing (maintainers)

[.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) builds and
pushes whenever a GitHub release is published. A release tagged `v0.10.1` publishes
`0.10.1`, `0.10` and, unless it is marked as a pre-release, `latest`. The workflow then
starts the pushed image and waits for `/api/health` before it counts as successful, and
it can be re-run by hand from the Actions tab.

**GHCR needs no setup** - it authenticates with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. A brand new
package is private, so make it public once (Packages > open-dungeon-master > Package
settings > Change visibility) for other people to pull it.

**Docker Hub is optional.** Set two repository secrets and it publishes there too;
without them the workflow succeeds and publishes to GHCR only.

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - your Docker ID, shown in the top-right menu on hub.docker.com.
  It is not necessarily your GitHub username, even if you sign in through GitHub.
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Account settings > Personal access tokens, Read/Write scope.
  Signing in through GitHub OAuth does not change this; a token is still how CI
  authenticates.

To publish under a different Docker ID, change `DOCKERHUB_IMAGE` in the workflow and the
`image:` default in `docker-compose.yml` to match.

The fork defaults to Lemonade's OpenAI-compatible API at
`http://127.0.0.1:13305/v1`, serving the exact model ID
`Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTP-ROCmFP4-GGUF-STRIX-embF16-headQ6`. Lemonade keeps the
model lifecycle and recipe settings; Lorekeeper only sends chat requests and
never treats model output as authoritative game state.

If the model is not already loaded, load it with Lemonade's control API:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:13305/api/v1/load \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model_name":"Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTP-ROCmFP4-GGUF-STRIX-embF16-headQ6"}'
```

The launcher does not load or unload models for you; this avoids colliding with
other local workloads. Confirm readiness with:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:13305/v1/health
```

Lemonade also serves the companion media endpoints from the same port:

- `/v1/audio/speech` with `kokoro-v1`
- `/v1/audio/transcriptions` with `Moonshine-Medium-Streaming`
- `/v1/images/generations` with `Z-Image-Turbo-TheNoise`

### Tool calls need thinking mode

This is the setting that matters most for a working table, and it is not obvious.
Under a long DM prompt, Qwen3.6 in non-thinking mode can narrate fights instead
of starting an encounter or calling `request_roll`. The app sends
`chat_template_kwargs: { enable_thinking: true }` on tool-decision calls and
keeps final narration non-thinking so it streams smoothly. Set `DM_THINKING=0`
only as a fallback when tool fidelity is not needed.

### Reasoning budget and latency

Left uncapped, a reasoning-enabled decision call can occasionally spiral for minutes
on a hard turn. Cap the reasoning budget on the server to roughly 1024-2048 tokens
(llama-server's `--reasoning-budget`, or the equivalent key in the preset INI).
Expect the tradeoff: tool-decision calls run about 50-100s and a full turn about
1.5-3 minutes on a single local GPU. Combat and multi-tool turns sit at the longer
end.

### presence_penalty

Keep `presence_penalty` at 0 for the DM. A meaningful presence penalty under the long
prompt suppresses tool calls (the model paraphrases the tool in prose instead of
emitting it). The app pins `presence_penalty: 0` in every request so a server-side
preset penalty cannot break tool calling; if you drive the model from somewhere else,
set it to 0 there too.

The pin is written after the per-role sampling settings are applied, and no sampling
profile offers `presence_penalty`, so this cannot be reintroduced from a settings
screen. Breaking dice rolling should not be one checkbox away.

### The same model on other LLM software

The setup is pure settings, so it ports to any OpenAI-compatible server with tool
calling. The key settings to replicate anywhere: **context 65536, temperature 0.7,
top-p 0.95, top-k 20, min-p 0, presence_penalty 0**, plus a way to enable reasoning
for tool calls. Then point the app at your server (admin panel, campaign Text Model
settings, or `OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL`). For Ollama, the committed
[Modelfile](models/qwen3.6-dm.Modelfile) bakes the same settings in:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.6:35b-a3b-q8_0
ollama create qwen3.6-dm -f models/qwen3.6-dm.Modelfile
# then point the app at http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1, model qwen3.6-dm
```

More backends and model guidance: [docs/text-backends.md](docs/text-backends.md).

## Image generation (Lemonade or ComfyUI)

The default image backend is Lemonade's OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/images/generations` endpoint with `Z-Image-Turbo-TheNoise`. It returns
`b64_json` images; the fork sends `size`, `steps=8`, and `cfg_scale=1`, then
stores the result locally. The model can be changed with
`LEMONADE_IMAGE_MODEL` and the endpoint with `OPENAI_IMAGE_BASE_URL`.

ComfyUI at `COMFYUI_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8188`) remains selectable
for character portraits, inline scene art, and top-down battle maps. Any
checkpoint works; the genre preset supplies the art style. If either image
backend is down or busy, these features fail soft to a placeholder or a plain
icon and the session keeps going.

All GPU-heavy media (Lemonade images, ComfyUI images, and TTS) run on a
**single serial media queue**. On a shared-memory iGPU the image model and the
DM model compete for the same pool, so jobs are serialized to avoid out-of-
memory stalls rather than run in parallel. Details in
[docs/image-generation.md](docs/image-generation.md).

## Voice (TTS and push-to-talk)

- **DM narration**: Lemonade/Kokoro at `LEMONADE_BASE_URL` (normally
  `http://127.0.0.1:13305`) via `/v1/audio/speech`, model `kokoro-v1`, renders
  each DM message to speech on the media queue. Set `KOKORO_URL` to use a
  standalone Kokoro-FastAPI server instead.
- **Push-to-talk**: Lemonade/Moonshine at the same base URL via
  `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, model `Moonshine-Medium-Streaming`, with a
  server-side WebM/Opus to PCM16 WAV conversion. Set `STT_URL` for a legacy
  faster-whisper-compatible service. Both paths keep the confirm-then-send
  step.
- **Ambience and music**: a library of public-domain cues (dungeons, forests,
  deserts, rivers, towns, crowds, taverns, wind, plus music and one-shot
  stings) that the AI DM, a human DM, or the engine following the scene can
  trigger. Volume and mute are per listener. No audio ships with the project;
  `npm run fetch-ambience` pulls it from public archives. See
  [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#ambience-and-music).

## Configuration and settings precedence

Most things are configurable in the app itself. When the same setting exists in
several places, the order is:

1. **Campaign settings** (in-game Text Model / image panels), which always win
2. **Admin panel** (`/admin`, stored in the database)
3. **Environment variables** (`.env.server`, see
   [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md))
4. Built-in defaults

Secrets (API keys, `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, Discord credentials) belong in `.env.server`
or the admin panel, never in code or `.env.local`.

## Admin panel

Log in as an admin and open `/admin` (linked from the account menu):

- **Server settings**: default text model backend / URL / API key, ComfyUI and
  image-worker URLs and checkpoint, TTS / STT URLs, Discord sign-in credentials, and
  the sign-up toggle (close registration once your party is in).
- **Users**: list everyone, promote / demote admins, delete accounts, and reset
  passwords; a temporary password is shown once, and the user must set a new one at
  their next login.

## Discord sign-in (optional)

1. Create an application at <https://discord.com/developers/applications>.
2. Under OAuth2, add the redirect URI `<public-url>/api/auth/discord/callback` using
   the exact URL players reach the app on: `http://<lan-host>:3005/...` on a LAN, or
   `https://your.domain/...` behind a reverse proxy.
3. Put the Client ID and Client Secret in the admin panel (or `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` /
   `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env.server`).
4. Behind a reverse proxy: set the **Public URL** in the admin panel's Server section
   (or `APP_PUBLIC_URL` in `.env.server`) to the address players use, e.g.
   `https://your.domain`.

The "Sign in with Discord" button appears automatically once both are set. Existing
users can link Discord to their account from Settings.

## Voice chat (optional)

The table can talk over live voice, in the lobby while everyone is still
building characters and at any point during play. The server runs its own SFU
(mediasoup) in-process, so there is no third-party service, no account and no
audio leaving your machine.

Voice is **off by default**: set `VOICE_ENABLED=1` to turn it on. It needs two
more things, and both are easy to miss:

1. **HTTPS.** Browsers block microphone access on plain http, so voice needs a
   reverse proxy with a certificate. `localhost` is exempt, so a single-machine
   install works as-is. (The push-to-talk speech-to-text button has always had
   this requirement too.)
2. **One extra open port, UDP and TCP.** Default `44444`. The audio is not HTTP
   and cannot go through your reverse proxy: open the port on the firewall
   pointing straight at the host. It is a single port, not a range, however
   many tables are running.

```bash
VOICE_ENABLED=1
VOICE_RTC_PORT=44444
# The address a player's BROWSER can reach this host on. Required for Docker
# or any NAT; leave empty only for a localhost-only install.
VOICE_ANNOUNCED_IP=203.0.113.10
# Optional: announce a hostname instead of the raw IP. Wins when set.
VOICE_DOMAIN=voice.example.com
```

Whatever is announced must resolve directly to the host. If your site sits
behind a Cloudflare proxy, point voice at the origin IP, or give `VOICE_DOMAIN`
a DNS-only "grey cloud" record: a proxied hostname resolves to Cloudflare, which
does not carry UDP, and the call will connect and then stay silent. Full
details, including the trade this makes with origin-IP privacy, are in
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

Because the server already knows where every token stands and whose turn it is,
voice can do things a separate call cannot:

- **Turn-taking** rides the floor the table already has (open, hold, spotlight,
  initiative). By default the panel just shows whose turn it is; a table that
  wants it can have players off the floor muted server-side. The DM is never
  muted, and anyone who cannot speak gets a Raise hand button.
- **Proximity**, off by default: distance on the battle map decides who hears
  whom, with whisper (5 ft) / normal / shout (120 ft), walls that muffle rather
  than block, and an option for downed characters to stop hearing the table.
  The DM always hears everyone.
- **Side rooms** the DM can open and move people between, for a private word or
  a split party. Moving somebody is instant, with no gap in their audio.

Each campaign turns voice and each rule on or off in its settings, and a server
owner can disable it entirely with `VOICE_ENABLED=0`. Full details in
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Physical and Bluetooth dice

With the campaign's dice policy set to allow real dice, each player can opt in and
then choose, per die shape, where that die's numbers come from:

- **Type it in**: roll your physical die and enter the result; the DM turn parks
  until the table's dice are in.
- **Server roll**: the server rolls that die for you with a cryptographic RNG, so
  a mixed handful (your d20, its damage dice) still submits in one go.
- **Pixels Bluetooth dice**: pair a [Pixels](https://gamewithpixels.com/) die and
  its rolls fill in as they land, with a blink-to-identify button and automatic
  fallback to typing if it disconnects. Web Bluetooth requires a Chromium-based
  browser and HTTPS (localhost is exempt), the same requirement voice has.

When every die in a request is covered by a Pixel or the server, the roll submits
itself as the last die settles. Dice-source choices are stored in the browser they
were made in, per device, and the d100 pairs no single Pixel, so it stays typed or
server-rolled.

## Storage and the single-writer rule

All state lives in a local SQLite database at `data/local-roleplay.sqlite` (override
with `SQLITE_DB_PATH`), encrypted at rest with the `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from
`.env.server`; losing the key means losing the data. The read-only Open5e content
pack (`data/content/open5e.sqlite`) stays unencrypted. The database driver is
synchronous and the app assumes **one Next.js process owns the database file**. Do
not run `npm run dev` and a production service against the same `data/` directory;
point dev at a scratch database with `SQLITE_DB_PATH`.

The single-process assumption goes beyond the database: the live event bus, the
DM turn queue, and the voice-chat rooms are all in-process state. Running two
instances behind a load balancer would split the table across processes, and a
restart ends any voice call in progress (players simply rejoin). One instance is
the supported shape.

## Campaign plugins

Campaigns can run in a **world pack**: a single JSON manifest that renames the
rules into a setting, with its own races, classes, spells, gear, monsters,
factions and lore, plus a brief telling the DM how that world sounds. It is a
pure name mapping. Every mechanic stays 5e, character sheets keep storing
canonical names, and a character built in one world still works in another.

Admins browse, install and remove packs under **Admin, Campaign plugins**, either
from a registry or by uploading a `.json` by hand. A registry of community packs
is built in, so a fresh install has something to browse; point a server somewhere
else with the **World registry URL** setting or `WORLD_REGISTRY_URL`, or set
either to `off` to browse none. Listing is not endorsing, and nothing installs
until an admin installs it.

Writing one is documented in [docs/worlds.md](docs/worlds.md), with
`src/lib/worlds/bundled/saltmarch.json` as the worked example.
