# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Open Dungeon Master as a single image. The app and its shared-table voice
# gateway run together in one container. Everything the app needs is baked in:
# the Next.js build, the Open5e content pack, and the MiniLM embedding model.
# Only the AI services stay outside (llama.cpp, ComfyUI, Kokoro TTS, STT).
#
# Built on glibc rather than Alpine: better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers and
# onnxruntime-node both publish glibc prebuilds, and musl would force a slow
# source compile of the first and has no build of the second at all. A
# scanner that proposes an Alpine tag is proposing an image that cannot run
# this app; OS-level fixes are taken with apt-get upgrade in both stages
# instead, which pulls the patched Debian packages at build time.

# re-adds the parts that are actually needed, at paths a volume cannot hide.
