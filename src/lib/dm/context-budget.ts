//    how much the operator wrote rather than by how the campaign is going, so
//    capping it first stops a long rules document from distorting every other
//    share.
// 2. History is the RESIDUAL, not a fixed share. NE-P's percentages
//    deliberately sum to less than the remainder (25 + 40 + 10 = 75%) and it
//    fits history into whatever is left. That degrades in the right
//    direction: a quiet scene with little state spends the slack on
//    transcript automatically.
//
// ODM's block kinds map onto NE-P's like this:
//   retrieval <- rulesBudget   (house rules and world lore, off the top)
//   rules     <- stable        (system prompt, genre, encounter/companion rules)
//   state     <- world         (the game-state block: sheets, NPCs, facts, arc)
//   chapters  <- volatile      (approximate: NE-P folds sealed chapters into
//                               its history LOD renderer, which ODM does not
//                               have yet, so they take the volatile slot)
