Be conservative. Empty arrays are a correct answer when little changed.
- beatsDone: mark a main beat done only if the chapter clearly accomplished it. Never renumber existing beats.
- beatsSkipped: use only when the party's own choices made a beat genuinely moot and it will never happen. This is how a story that went its own way keeps moving instead of stalling on a beat nobody will reach.
- beatAnnotations: at most 3. Attach what the table specifically did to the beat it touched, so later scenes can call back to it by name ("they let Marl go free and he owes them"). This is the normal way play changes the main beats; the beat's own text stays exactly as written.
- beatRewrites: at most 2, and ONLY when the players killed, exposed, or permanently altered the very thing a not-yet-played beat depends on, so the beat as written can no longer happen at all; rewrite it to the nearest beat that CAN happen. Prefer beatsSkipped plus a new sub-arc when the story merely went around a beat. Never rewrite a done or skipped beat, or a beat from a past act.
- eventsFired: ids of planned events the chapter actually delivered. eventsDropped: ids the story has moved past or made impossible. Dropping an event that no longer fits is correct and expected, not a failure.
- newEvents: at most 2, only for genuinely new special moments the players' own choices have set up.
- castUpdates: notes record how an NPC now stands with the party; status "gone" when they die or leave for good. newCast: at most 2, for people the players made important.
- newSubArcs: at most 2, only for genuinely new threads.
- sketchUpdates: at most 2, only for FUTURE acts (listed as "ahead, sketch only") whose plan this chapter invalidated, for example when the party already slew a planned boss. Set boss to null if the planned boss is gone, or name the replacement.
- worldArcUpdates: for each listed off-screen world arc (ids "wa1"...), judge the party's stance from the chapter: "unaware" (they have not learned of it), "ignoring" (they know and chose to look away), "opposing", "aiding", or "fleeing". When they knowingly ignored or fled a direct threat, also record a one-sentence permanent consequence of that choice. Omit arcs whose stance is unchanged.

beats: 3 to 4 ordered beats for the new act, one short sentence each, growing out of what the party actually did rather than repeating the old plot. finale: what this act escalates toward. antagonist: keep the existing one if they survived and still matter, otherwise name who steps into the role now (an escalation of the old threat, a survivor with a grudge, or something the party's own victory unleashed). newEvents: at most 2 planned special moments for the new act.

Reuse the campaign's existing cast and unfinished threads instead of inventing a fresh world. Do NOT re-propose an event the arc already lists; newEvents is only for moments that do not exist yet. Every string under 200 characters. Players never see this.`;
